## Project Overview

During an 18-month engagement with npower, I spearheaded a comprehensive website modernisation initiative that transformed the digital presence of one of the UK's major energy providers. The project involved converting the main npower website and five major campaign microsites from outdated table-based HTML layouts to modern, standards-based CSS architecture.

## The Challenge

The npower web estate was built using legacy table-based layouts, which presented multiple challenges:

- Poor maintainability and scalability across multiple sites
- Accessibility barriers for users with disabilities
- Slow page load times due to inefficient HTML structure
- Inconsistent styling across properties
- Difficulty implementing responsive design principles

The project required a strategic approach to modernise the entire web presence while maintaining brand consistency across the corporate site and major campaign initiatives.

## Solution & Approach

### Systematic Site Conversion

I led the conversion of six distinct web properties:

- **Main npower corporate website** - The flagship property with complex information architecture
- **npower Cricket** - Campaign site for sports sponsorship
- **npower Education** - Educational outreach initiative
- **Health Through Warmth** - Social responsibility campaign
- **Good Food Show** - Partnership and event marketing site
- **Ideal Home Show** - Consumer-facing campaign site

Each site was methodically converted from table-based layouts to semantic HTML with external CSS stylesheets, following the W3C Web Standards recommendations that were current at the time.

### Accessibility-First Implementation

Rather than treating accessibility as an afterthought, I implemented it as a core design principle:

- Restructured HTML to use proper semantic markup
- Implemented ARIA landmarks and roles where necessary
- Ensured proper heading hierarchies (H1, H2, H3 structure)
- Created keyboard-navigable interfaces
- Tested against WCAG and Web Accessibility Guideline standards
- Worked with assistive technology to verify real-world usability

## Results & Recognition

### Industry Awards

The accessibility-focused approach earned significant industry recognition:

- **Guild of Accessible Websites - Site of the Month** award
- This was a prestigious award recognising excellence in web accessibility during a time when accessibility was not widely prioritised in the industry

### Compliance Achievements

- **WAG Level 3 compliance** - Achieved all automated checkpoints at the highest level of the Web Accessibility Guidelines
- This was particularly notable as Level 3 compliance was considered best-in-class for the energy sector

### Business Impact

- Improved user experience for all visitors, with particular benefit to users with disabilities
- Reduced page load times across the portfolio by simplifying HTML structure
- Established reusable CSS patterns and components that could be applied across future projects
- Created a foundation for more maintainable and scalable web infrastructure

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of:

1. **Standards-based development** - Following W3C recommendations ensures longevity and compatibility
2. **Accessibility as a feature, not a bolted-on requirement** - Building accessibility in from the start is more efficient and produces better results
3. **Systematic project management** - Coordinating across multiple sites required careful planning and consistent processes
4. **Education and advocacy** - Helping stakeholders understand the business value of web standards and accessibility

This work was foundational to my understanding that digital accessibility benefits everyone and should be a core consideration in any web project.
